# Fishify
Fishify is a new way for merchants to connect with consumers at fish markets
Thus far, there is no application that focuses soley on markets, which are the primary location to purchase groceries in towns throughout the 3rd world 
Fishify allows for merchants to list their foods and for buyers to directly connect and find the best deals
